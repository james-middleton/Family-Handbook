#Family Handbook

##A guide to the school for parents, carers and other family members

#Introduction 

##Welcome to the Darlinghurst School Family Handbook

This handbook provides information for families on all aspects of school life. The handbook, used together with the school website, outlines the school’s administrative arrangements and policies, as well as information about day-to-day life at Darlinghurst.

The handbook has been written to answer questions you may have about children’s time at school. However, if you have any individual
questions or concerns about your child’s education, or the care of your child while they are at Darlinghurst, the staff, including the Principal Mrs Patrick, are always willing to discuss this. You can find their contact details in the handbook and on the school website. 

The handbook is meant to be a 'living', which menas that it can change. If you would like to change something in it or add something to it email principal@darlinghurst.co.uk

#Staff at Darlinghurst
There is a wide range of staff at Darlinghurst, who have varied and valuable skills and expertise. The majority of teachers also take on additional voluntary responsibilities, such as running afterschool or lunchtime clubs. Darlinghurst has a total of five cover tutors who are available to cover classes should a regular teacher be unable to attend. [Mention background checks?]

###Teachers

Teachers at Darlinghurst are responsible for developing work and lesson plans in line with the school curriculum. This includes
developing learning resources and making sure that classrooms are places that help learning. The teachers are also responsible for helping children to develop the necessary skills and abilities appropriate to their age and aptitude, assessing and recording
progress against national standards, and preparing children for tests and exams.

Some teachers are not in class for the full five days because they have responsibilities in other areas of the school. Where this is
the case the school makes sure there is continuity in terms of who is responsible for the class on the other days.

You can contact all teachers via email, or arrange a meeting with them if you would like to talk in depth about your child’s needs,
or any other concerns. You can find teachers’ email addresses on the school website. They follow the pattern: [teacher’s title and surname]@darlinghurstschool.co.uk

#Parent–School Communication 

[To be added]

##The school website
The address of school website is [www.darlinghurst.uk](www.darlinghurst.uk). It is regularly updated and includes contact
details for teachers and other staff members. 

In the [Information for Parents](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/information/) section you will find a school [Calendar](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/calendar/) with dates of
school outings, plays, shows, and other school events. 

Current and past editions of the weekly News & Views school newsletter are also posted here, along with links to school policies and
other useful information.

The [News](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/news/)section shows pictures  and videos of recent school activities, celebrating the children 
and their achievements. (Darlinghurst has a strict children protection policy. Children’s photos will only appear on the
website with their parents’ permission. For this reason, _**we ask families not to take photos or videos at school events**_.

##The Parents and Teachers Association (PTA) 
Darlinghurst parents and teachers association (PTA) is a group that organises events during the school year to raise money for the
‘little extras’ that benefit all children during their time at the school. These are things that the normal school budget does not
normally cover, such as …

Meetings are usually held each half term, in the morning, straight after school drop-off and are open to anyone with a child at the
school. If childcare is a problem, you are welcome to bring younger brothers and sisters along too.

Meeting dates are usually advertised well in advance in the weekly [News & Views school newsletter](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/information/) and on the school website under
[Darlinghurst PTA](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/information/darlinghurst-pta/). The school also sends out text message reminders.
You will get these automatically if you have already registered your mobile number with the School Office.

###What is it for?
The PTA can use any spare time that you are willing to give. You could be making tea at children's performances, 
dressing as an elf for the Christmas fair, making cakes or looking after a bouncy castle at an inflatable fun day. Any contributions 
of time or skills are gratefully received.

If you are interested in joining, go to the [PTA page](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/information/darlinghurst-pta/) on the school website or the [PTA’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Darlinghurst-School-PTA-Leigh-on-Sea-213317208690232/)
or email [darlinghurstpta@hotmail.com](darlinghurstpta@hotmail.com)

You can also find the [Darlinghurst School PTA](https://m.facebook.com/Darlinghurst-School-PTA-Leigh-on-Sea-213317208690232/) on Facebook.

The PTA is a great way to meet new people and become part of the school community.

##The Darlinghurst Community Forum
The Darlinghurst Community Forum is a group made up predominantly of, but not limited to, parent volunteers, the Principal and members of staff. 

###What is it for?
The Forum is an opportunity for open, positive, respectful discussion about issues that affect the whole school. 

For specific concerns about children, your first point of call should always be their class teacher. For issues to do with staff, contact the School Office or email [principal@darlinghurst.co.uk](principal@darlinghurst.co.uk)

Examples of issues that have been discussed include:

* Handwriting
* Homework
* Grading and school reports
* The curriculum

* Road safety and safer crossing
* School building works and plans
* Clubs and extra-curricular activities
* Summer School

###How it works
The Forum runs an active Facebook group. It also meets six times a year. Dates are set each half term so that as many people as possible can attend. Dates are announced in News & Views (http://www.darlinghurst.uk/information/). Meetings take place at the school during the week, usually between 1.30pm and 3.15pm,

###Contact the Forum

##Workshops for parents 

[To be added]

#The Governing Body 
The members of the [Governing Body](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/policies-and-governance/governors/) – governors – make sure that all children’s progress well in their education and that coming to
Darlinghurst improves their prospects.

The governors make sure that the principal and senior teachers are doing what they should to improve children’s learning outcomes –
for example, how they do in reading writing and maths – and in an enjoyable and safe environment. 

To see for themselves, the governors visit the school and talk with staff, children, parents and carers. They are also part of important recruitment and financial decisions.

>_The Governing Body works with the principal and senior teachers to design the annual [**Academy Improvement Plan**]( http://www.darlinghurst.uk/school/improvement-plan/) and checks that
>teachers are following this._

The Governing Body meets once a month. It is made up of 10 governors, who include the Darlinghurst principal and at least one other staff member, and two elected parent governors. 

Along with Belfairs Academy and Cecil Jones Academy, Darlinghurst is part of the **Legra Multi Academy Trust**. The chair of the
Darlinghurst Governing Body and Darlinghurst’s principal are also part of the LEGRA Governing Body, which meets separately once a month. 

Legra’s executive principal and two Legra-appointed governors are also part of the Governing Body. The members of the Governing Body appoint the remaining governors, who may come from the local community.

Governors focus on different areas of school life – their portfolios. These include:

* Effectiveness of leadership and management
* Children’s behaviour, personal development and welfare
* Quality of teaching, learning and assessment
* Outcomes for children
* Effectiveness of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)

The Governing Body reports its activites in its annual [Impact Statement](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/policies-and-governance/governors/impact-statement/).

If you are interested in becoming a governor email [principal@darlinghurst.co.uk](mailto:principal@darlinghurst.co.uk)

##Junior Governors

>_The Junior Governors represented Darlinghurst at the **2015 School Council Summit** at Milton Hall Primary School in Southend, to talk about what they have been doing at Darlinghurst and sharing ideas._

The [Junior Governors](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/policies-and-governance/governors/junior-governors/) are elected by their classmates. They are made up of one girl and one boy from each Key Stage 2 class. 
They also represent Key Stage 1 classes under a ‘buddy system’, so each Key Stage 1 class is linked with a Key Stage 2 junior governor. 

The Junior Governors make sure that children have a voice in decisions about the school. They meet every two weeks at lunchtime and
have discussed issues such as healthy eating, homework, and deciding which local charity to support They also take part in
interviewing new teachers.

#The School Day

##School opening and closing times

* **8.15am** School gates open
* **8.40am** Children come into school
* **8.45am** Registration begins
* **8.55am** Registration closes – children arriving after this time are late and have to go to reception at the front of the school
* **8.55am** Morning session begins
* **3.10pm** School gates open; Nursery day ends
* **3.30pm** School day ends
* **4.00pm** School gates are locked; to collect children from afterschool clubs and Acorns, go to the side entrance next to the
* carpark.

You can access the school grounds through two entrances at the front – one through the gate and the other next to the car park, which
also leads to the bike shed. There is a third entrance to the grounds from Prittle Brook. The entrance to the School Office reception
is at the front of the school.

It is important to collect children promptly from their designated collection point, usually their classrooms. If you are late, children will be taken to the Acorns afterschool club where they will be looked after until collection. You will have to pay for the Acorns session.

If you expect to be late for pick up, call the School Office and someone will make sure that teachers are aware and can make any arrangements necessary. 

###Nursery
The morning session in the Nursery runs from 8.30am and finishes at 11.30am. To collect children you should use the Prittle Brook
entrance and walk through the playground to the nursery. This gate is opened at 11.25am and locked when the last parent has left. 

The afternoon session at Darlinghurst pre-school runs from 12 noon and finishes at 3.10pm. 

##Travel to and from school
Darlinghurst encourages active travel to and from school. It is hoped that parents and children living local to the school will opt
to walk, cycle or scoot to school. This ensures that exercise is built into the day, and that congestion on the roads is kept to a
minimum during rush hour. 

###Safe crossing points
[To be added.]

###Parking
All parking at Darlinghurst school car park is reserved for teachers and other other staff members. There is a limited parking
available in surrounding streets, but these are residential and parents are asked to be aware, and considerate, of the school’s
neighbours. Inconsiderate parking across local driveways, on double yellow lines, and directly in front of the school has been an
issue in the past, and local residents have complained. 

##Attendance and absence
Regular attendance and punctuality is essential if children are to make maximum progress in their education. Although attendance and
punctuality have improved, Darlinghurst needs families’ help to make sure this continues.

The school is legally obliged to keep records of absence. To keep records up to date, on the first day of absence, or before if it is
appropriate, parents/carers must let the school know why children will not be at school. You can do this by:

* Calling the school on 01702 478379 before 10am on the first day of absence; choose Option 1 and leave a voice message.
* Telling someone in the School Office in person.

School policy is to call parents on the first day of absence if they have not been in contact beforehand. On return to school,
children should bring a signed note/letter detailing the illness and action taken.

###Family holidays in term time

Any absence from school needs to be avoided wherever possible because it can have a serious effect on young children’s education
and development. The school will not give permission for any term-time holidays.

Research shows that children who miss 17 or more days from school during just one academic year can fall behind as much as one National Curriculum level. Missing 5 days means your child will lose 25 hours of learning, which is equal to:

* 5 hours of maths
* 5 hours of English
* 10 hours of other lessons e.g. science, history, computing
* 6 hours of social time

>_2 weeks' holiday = 50 hours’ learning; 2 weeks' holiday and 1 week’s illness = 75 hours’ learning!_

##Help and advice

If you need any help or advice about attendance, the school Family Liaison Officer Mr Noades is in school every day and Miss Walton is available in the School Office on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays between 8.00am and 4.00pm. You can aloso contact Miss Walton by phone and email:

Tel: 01702 509203

##Daily routine 

Classrooms are open from 8.30am. The register closes at 8.55am. If children arrive after this time they will be marked as late.

If you arrive after 8.55am, you should go to the School Office, at the front of the school, and a member of staff will take children to their classroom or the nursery.

###Acorns Afterschool Club
Acorns is separate and different from afterschool activity clubs. Pupils can attend from 3.30pm to 6.00pm for £6 per day (£5 if you pay in advance). 

###Lunchtime and afterschool activities

Other lunch time and after school clubs are rotated by staff each half term. Every child will have the opportunity to sign up for at
least one club at some point during the year. If spaces are limited, children who have not been able to go to any clubs before then
get priority. 

_To drop off and pick up children from clubs out of normal school hours you can access the school through the carpark entrance._

##Lunch and school meals
For most pupils, school lunches cost £2 per child. You should pay at the start of the week by giving the money in an envelope to the class teacher. You can buy envelopes from the School Office. You can also pay in advance by cheque, making cheques payable to
Darlinghurst School and handing them in at the School Office.

#The Curriculum at Darlinghurst

##Early Years Foundation Stage (Nursery and Reception)

###What is the Early Years Foundation Stage?
The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) at Darlinghurst is for children aged 3–5 and covers the Nursery and Reception classes – the
Foundation Stage. It is a ‘foundation stage’ because it lays the foundation for all future learning.

Children develop quickly during their early years – physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially. Darlinghurst’s teachers,
nursery nurses – each Nursery class has two nursery nurses, and each Reception class has one – and learning support assistants (LSAs)
make sure that all children feel included, safe and valued.

###EYFS principles
The EYFS at Darlinghurst is based on:

* Parents as partners: parents and teachers/nursery nurses/LSAs working together, with mutual respect
* Building on what children already know and can do, from individual starting points
* Making sure no child is excluded or disadvantaged
* Providing opportunities for indoor and [outdoor learning](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/school/outdoor-learning/), including school trips
* Creating a rich and stimulating environment. 

###Learning and lessons
EYFS learning is play based and finds a balance between child-initiated activities – chosen by the children – and adult-led ones –
chosen by the teacher or LSA. Each class has its own teacher and LSA.

Structured lessons (handwriting, maths, phonics) make up about 20% of lesson time. Darlinghurst uses the Letters and Sounds
programme, which uses **phonics** to teach children to read and spell. 

>_Using **phonics** teaches children to recognise the sounds that different letters and groups of letters make, and how to blend these
>sounds together to make a word. They can then use this knowledge to ‘decode’ new words that they see or hear._

The rest of the lesson time is made up of free-choice activities, based on the curriculum, to encourage independent learning. This
teaches children to explore, experiment, be curious and find things out for themselves. 

Children’s achievements are recorded in their individual Learning Journey book. In addition, they all have writing books with
examples of their work to show their progress. Each child’s level of development is recorded against 17 Early Learning Goals.

###The EYFS curriculum
The EYFS curriculum at Darlinghurst is divided into seven areas.

* **Personal, social and emotional development** – making relationships, developing self-confidence, -awareness and -control, and
learning to work, play and co-operate in a group; it includes learning about [British Values](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/school/british-values/)
* **Communication and language** – listening and paying attention, understanding and speaking.
* **Physical development** – movement and handling equipment, health and self-care, and healthy lifestyles.
* **Literacy** – phonics, reading, mark-making and writing, including ‘Think and write for 5’. 
* **Maths** – numbers and counting, shape, space and measures. 
* **Understanding of the world** – people and communities, the world and technology. This is a foundation for knowledge about science,
* history and geography.
* **Expressive arts and design** – exploring creative and imaginative self-expression through art, music and drama, using different media
* and materials.

For more information about the EYFS curriculum, contact Mrs Dutton [mrsdutton@darlinghurst.co.uk](mrsdutton@darlinghurst.co.uk)

You can read Darlinghurst’s [EYFS Policy]( http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/early-years-foundation-stage-policy.pdf) in full on the school website.

You can find out more about the [Letters and Sounds]( http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/phonics-at-darlinghurst.pdf) programme on the school website.

##Key Stages 1 and 2: Years 1–6
As an academy, Darlinghurst does not have to follow the National Curriculum. The school can also set its own term times, but still has to follow the same rules on admissions, special educational needs and exclusions as other state schools.

Darlinghurst uses the [EdisonLearning Primary Connected Curriculum](http://edisonlearning.net/primary-curriculum/), which is designed
to join up different school subjects, and to connect to children’s lives outside school. It finds a balance between knowledge and
skills – between knowing and doing. 

In addition to English and maths, the connected curriculum divided into ‘foundation’ and ‘core’ subjects. 

* **Foundation**: history, geography, design and technology, art and music
* **Core**: science.

The school also provides religious education (RE), physical education (PE) and modern foreign languages.

Under the connected curriculum, teachers follow an ‘adopt, adapt, create’ plan, which means that there is no set timetable for
different subjects, but each one gets a special focus each half-term over the school year. 

##Core Learning Skills Curriculum
Core skills are personal learning and life skills that children develop beside subject learning. They are a second layer of the
curriculum and teachers focus on one each half-term.

**The Core Learning Skills**

* Learning with others
* Developing independence and responsibility
* Improving your own learning and performance
* Developing a sense of self-worth, and of who you are and
your place in the world
* Thinking skills
* Speaking and listening.

The aim is that pupils at Darlinghurst:

* Are creative, resourceful and can solve problems 
* Understand how they learn and learn from their mistakes
* Can learn independently and take the initiative
* Have enquiring minds and think for themselves
* Want to try new things and make the most of opportunities
* Enjoy learning and are motivated, engaged and interested in
their lessons
* Want to achieve the best they can now and in the future
* Know the difference between right and wrong
* Are self-aware and deal well with their emotions
* Form stable relationships inside and outside of school, and
are socially responsible
* Have self-confidence in their team skills, can learn
cooperatively with others and are good members of a social group. 

The [Curriculum](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/curriculum/) page of the school website has links to overviews of what each year group
will be learning over the course of the year, under the Downloads section http://www.darlinghurst.uk/school/curriculum/

You can read more about the [Core Learning Skills Curriculum](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/core-learning-skills-curriculum.pdf) on the school website. 

##British Values

###Being British
The government’s Department for Education (DfE) wants ‘to create and enforce a clear and rigorous expectation on all schools to
promote the fundamental British values.’

The DfE lists five parts to British values:

* Democracy
* The rule of law
* Individual liberty
* Mutual respect
* Tolerance of those of different faiths and beliefs.

The teaching of spiritual, moral, social and cultural (SMSC) matters across the whole school curriculum actively promotes all of
these values. 

>_‘British Values’ and ‘100 people’ displays around the school show information about the core British values, as well as helping
>children understand the complex issues facing the planet and the resources people have to share by showing the global population as
>100 people._

The school values the diverse backgrounds of all of its children, their families and people in the wider community, and organises
events and lessons to celebrate them. This teaches tolerance and respect for the differences in the local community and the world. 

The school behaviour policy is based on respect as a core value and the importance of rules, whether they are those that govern a
classroom, the school or the country. 

>_The whole school – children and adults – discussed and agreed on the **school values**: creativity, achievement, respect and
>enjoyment (CARE)._ 

Within the boundaries of the school rules, children are given individual liberty and are encouraged to make considered decisions for
themselves. That might be in their choice of challenge in a lesson, how they record their work, running for a junior governor
position, or taking part in extracurricular activities. 

The also learn about individual liberty through e-safety – staying safe online, on the internet and social media, using computers and
other digital technology – and personal, social and health education (PSHE) lessons that show children how to safely exercise their
rights and personal freedoms.

The whole school votes for the members of the [Junior Governors](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/policies-and-governance/governors/junior-governors/). This teaches children about democracy, and reminds them how valued
their opinions are and how they can play an important role in decisions that affect the school. 

The school holds regular school assemblies that promote empathy, respect and tolerance besides the core school values, as well as
covering key religious festivals across the year. These values are also taught in formal personal development lessons and RE lessons,
as well as informally throughout the school day. Parents and other members of the community also visit the school to share their
experiences and beliefs.

##Sex and relationships education
Teachers at Darlinghurst feel that the primary role in children’s sex and relationship education lies with parents and carers. They
want to help parents through mutual understanding, trust and cooperation. But parents have the right to withdraw their child from all or part of the school’s sex and relationships education programme. 

Darlinghurst teaches sex and relationship education in different parts of the curriculum. This is mainly as part of personal, social
and health education curriculum, but also in other subject areas (e.g. science). 

Children learn about: 

* The physical development of their bodies as they grow into adults
* The way human’s reproduce
* Respect for their own bodies and the importance of sexual activity as part of a committed, long-term, and healthy and loving
* relationship
* The importance of family life
* Moral questions
* Relationship issues
* Respect for other people’s views
* Sex abuse and what to do if they are worried about any sexual matters
* The issue of consent.

Children learn about sex and relationship education in the context of the school’s aims and values. While this means that teachers
give children information about relationships and sexual behaviour, they do this with an awareness of the moral code and values that
underpin all work in school. In particular, Darlinghurst teaches sex education in the belief that: 
* Children should learn to have respect for their own bodies.
* Children should learn about their responsibilities to others, and be aware of the consequences of sexual activity.
* Children should learn that it is important to build positive relationships with others, involving trust and respect.

For more information, see Darlinghurst’s [Relationship and Sex Education Policy](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/relationship-and-sex-education-policy-2015.pdf) or contact Assistant Principal Mrs Cooke
[mrscooke@darlinghurst.co.uk](mrscooke@darlinghurst.co.uk)

##Computing and coding at Darlinghurst
The Information Communications and Technology (ICT) curriculum changed to Computing in 2015, with an emphasis on learning 
to code – how to write computer programmes. 

During computing lessons children use a variety of software, including licensed packages, such as Microsoft Office, and also
freeware, which is free to download and use at home. The school curriculum provides opportunities to use ICT in other subjects as
well.

Find out more about [computing and coding](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/information/computing-and-coding/) on the school website, including links to usefull resources.

##English at Darlinghurst

###Reading
Darlinghurst uses the [Letters and Sounds](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/phonics-at-darlinghurst.pdf) programme, which uses phonics to teach children to read and spell. Children in Key Stage 1
(Years 1 and 2) have daily phonics lessons. They continue to have regular phonics sessions up to the end of Year 3, as do older
children who need help. (For more about phonics, see the section in the handbook on the Early Years Foundation Stage, above.)

At least once a week, children share a reading book with a teacher, learning support assistant or reading volunteer – often parents,
carers or older children. Their performance is recorded in their Reading Record book, with next steps to show how parents and carers
can help them at home. Parents and carers are also asked to keep a record of reading at home in the book.

School reading books follow [coloured reading band schemes](https://www.readingchest.co.uk/book-bands), which are a guide to the ability and age range the book is aimed at.
Darlinghurst uses a variety of schemes, including Oxford Reading Tree, All Aboard, GINN and Project X to introduce children to a wide range of writing styles.

In Key Stages 1 and 2 (up to Year 6) lessons include 30 minutes of timetabled guided reading each day. Teachers also use activities
including drama, talking about texts, and written exercises to help children understand what they are reading. 

In guided reading sessions children read the same **text**, from a wide variety of styles, three times. The teachers then ask deeper, thought-provoking questions that look closely at the author’s choice of words and the way the writing works. 

>_A **text** is any piece of writing, fiction (e.g. made-up stories, poems) or non-fiction (e.g. based on facts to give information,
>such as news)._

It is important not to rush through a text or think that something is more challenging because of the number of words. Picture books
are also important in learning about how stories are made.

Teachers at Darlinghurst believe that reading for pleasure is the foundation of the children’s moral, spiritual and academic
development. It will give them enjoyment, but also skills for lifelong learning.

Children can easily get books in their classrooms and from the school library. Teachers encourage them to use the library during
playtimes and lunchtimes, as well as timetabled slots, to make sure they can get high-quality reading materials whenever they wish.

###Writing
Teachers at Darlinghurst believe that the best writers are also readers – when you read, you learn how stories are made and use this
in your own writing. And you cannot write well without understanding how language sounds when you speak it. So, speaking and
listening are also the building blocks of successful writing. 

English teaching at Darlinghurst lets children hear, say and read different styles of language. They learn to imitate writing from
their class reading books, with games and activities that help them understand what the writing means and to learn to use the
language themselves. They also learn to plan, edit and think about their writing. This includes learning aboutgrammar, punctuation
and spelling (spelling tests continue up to Year 6). 

>_**Write for 10** is a daily activity that improves imagination, creative writing and writing stamina. Children write for 10 minutes
>in response to an idea – sometimes linked to the curriculum, but usually a stand-alone piece of creative writing – then mark one
>another’s work._

###Handwriting
Scientific research shows that learning to write with a pencil or pen on paper teaches young children how to handle objects.
Handwriting skills also help with reading, because children write down what they are learning in terms of spelling and sentence
construction. 

Teachers at Darlinghurst believe that neat, well-formed handwriting and written exercises lead to better results, because children
take pride in their work and have a sense of ownership. 

You can download an [English grammar and punctuation glossary](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/grammar-glossary.pdf) from the school website. It explains what different terms mean and gives examples of how to use them.

##Maths at Darlinghurst

Darlinghurst uses the [Maths Mastery curriculum](http://www.mathematicsmastery.org/what-we-do/primary-school-programme/), which is based on the idea that children learn better by covering fewer topics, but in greater depth. It teaches understanding rather than
learning by rote (memorising answers without knowing why they are right). 

The maths curriculum at Darlinghurst has three sections:

* **Objects and pictures** – children use 'concrete manipulatives' (maths equipment and kits you can hold, such as Dienes blocks, Numicon shapes, bead strings) and 'pictorial representations' (pictures) before moving to 'abstract symbols' (things that do not physically exist – e.g. numbers, signs and symbols).
* **Language development** – the way that children speak and write about maths affects how well they do. Teachers use a careful plan to introduce and reinforce mathematical language. Every lesson, children have a chance to explain how they worked out their answers,
* using ‘star words’ (maths vocabulary) and full sentences.
* Problem solving – this is how and why children learn maths.

By learning different ways to answer questions, children can develop and test
their problem-solving skills every lesson.

>_To keep up with changes in the **National Curriculum**, children at Darlinghurst will learn number bonds (adding numbers together)
>to 20 by Year 2 and times tables up to 12x12 by the end of Year 4. They will spend more time learning how to write long
>multiplication and division. They will also learn fractions, decimals and negative numbers to a higher level, to be ready for maths
>at secondary school._

Each week, children in Key Stages 1 and 2 have at least four guided maths lessons and one 45-minute mental maths lesson (doing sums
in their heads). They also have three to five 10–20-minute ‘maths meetings’ to practise core skills (e.g. number bonds, times
tables).

The curriculum covers areas that include: counting and estimating, calculation, 2D and 3D shape, measure, time, money, data,
statistics, and using tables and charts.

As part of the connected curriculum, teachers use real life examples whenever possible and make links to other subjects (e.g.
science, geography).

You can find an [overview of the curriculum](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/maths-at-darlinghurst.pdf) for each year group on the school website 

Under the [Maths](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/school/curriculum/maths/) section of the website, you can also read the school's Maths policies in full, find a [calculation glossary of terms](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/calculation-glossary-of-terms.pdf)
and see slides from previous maths workshops.

##Music at Darlinghurst
At Darlinghurst, all children from the Nursery through to Year 6 have an opportunity to learn about and make music. The school music
curriculum introduces children to instruments of the orchestra; storytelling through music; musical theatre, with Year 5 and 6 trips
to London's West End; styles of music including classical, pop, rock, gospel, jazz and world music; film music; and song-writing,
music technology and composition.

>_Darlinghurst won ‘**Best School Choir**’ at the 2015 Village Green in Chalkwell Park. More than 100 children were enrolled in music
>classes at the school in 2015/16.

Mrs Collison and Miss Bernard lead the school choir, which performs in school and also in the local community, and Mrs Rott takes the
Recorder Club for Years 3 and 4. 

A yearly school musical also gives children the chance to perform with a live band of visiting professional musicians. Productions
have included adaptations of Robin Hood and Aladdin.

Children also have the chance to learn instruments with visiting music teachers. You have to pay for these lessons, but it is
possible to hire instruments from the school. Children registered as Pupil Premium are eligible for a 50% discount on all lessons and hire; the school covers the other 50%.

The school currently offers lessons for the keyboard, flute, clarinet, saxophone, drums, guitar (electric or acoustic), ukulele,
violin and singing. 

An informal lunchtime Music Theory Club, which is free of charge, also helps those learning instruments, whether at school or
independently.

##Physical education and sports
All children at Darlinghurst take part in one hour of PE each week. There are also 16 sports and activity clubs that run before and
after school, and playground leaders keep the children active at lunchtimes.

Sports and activities include:

* Dodgeball
* Football
* Futsal
* Gymnastics
* Hockey
* Karate
* Kwik cricket
* Netball
* Rounders
* Running
* Sports hall athletics
* Street dance
* Table tennis
* Tag rugby

>_From xxxx children in Year x will also be able to take swimming lessons at earls Hall Primary School._

Darlinghurst has one full-time PE teacher and a part-time assistant. A number of teachers are involved with the sports clubs, and
parent volunteers help with the netball club. 

Outside companies run some of the clubs, including ASSA Football, Premier Performing Arts, Supreme Soccer and Westwood Karate (you
have to pay for some of these clubs). Darlinghurst also has links to local sports clubs such as Southend United Football Club,
Southend and Benfleet Hockey Club and Shoebury Athletics club. The children are invited try out or join these clubs.

Activities follow the seasons. They are linked with local school sports competitions and also international events, such as the
Olympics and Paralympics. Each year, the school houses LINK have a chance to compete against one another on Sports Day. Darlinghurst
also celebrates individual achievements out of school in the weekly [News & Views](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/information/) newsletter.

>_The idea behind competing in sports at school and in tournaments and festivals is that it teaches British values such as
>**fairness** and **respect**, builds character, and gives children the chance to achieve their best._

The aim at Darlinghurst is to get all children more engaged in PE, to become more physically confident and understand the importance
of a healthy and active lifestyle. The school has started a health-related fitness programme across all year groups. 

Topics the children learn about include:

* Healthy hearts and benefits of exercise
* Co-ordination and balance
* Agility, speed and flexibility
* Circuit training
* Muscular endurance and core strength
* Setting realistic fitness goals.

###PE kit (boys and girls)

* Gold T-shirt
* Red shorts
* Red sweatshirt and red jogging bottoms can also be worn for outdoor PE in the winter months

PE kit should be kept in a tie string bag. No jewellery may be worn during PE sessions. If children cannot remove jewellery, they
will not be able to take part in the lesson. This is in line with guidelines from the [Southend Primary School Sports Association](http://www.spssa.co.uk/), which runs all the inter-school sporting competitions in Southend.

You can read more about how Darlinghurst spends the money it receives as [Sports Premium](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/school/sports-premium/) funding on the school website.

##Religious education
Darlinghurst has a broad and balanced RE curriculum that teaches children about different faiths and the importance of respecting
people’s beliefs. Pupils learn about the impact of faith and the challenges of living by a faith in the 21st Century.

They learn about Christianity in its local, national and global forms, as well as other major religions in the United Kingdom
(Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism), religions of local significance, and secular beliefs. 

Pupils also learn about the key beliefs, teachings and practices of religions and how these affect people’s daily lives. They think
about their own experiences and their knowledge of these religions, particularly with reference to questions of identity, belonging,
meaning, purpose, truth, values and commitment.

#Homework and Independent Learning 
Pupils at Darlinghurst get different types of homework, including weekly spellings, reading and maths. Sometimes, homework may be a
creative project – designing or making something. The amount of time homework takes will vary depending on children’s ages.

##Should parents/carers help with homework?

Yes! Teachers at Darlinghurst believe in working together with families to help children to learn. All primary school children need
regular help with their homework. Older children also need help, but should be able to work more independently. 

You can help in different ways:

* Find a good time – competing with TV, sport or clubs can make things harder. 
* Find a good place – for example, somewhere without distractions, with a table and chair, and good light.
* Find the right tools – a pencil and paper are often enough, but you may need other things.
* Find out the time scale – how long should the homework take?
* Find out when the homework due back at school. 

It is also useful to have a homework toolkit at home. It could include, for example:

* Pencils, pens, crayons
* Paper, cardboard
* A rubber and ruler
* Paints and brushes
* Scissors
* Sticky tape, glue
* A dictionary

##The homework timetable
Each class teacher is responsible for setting homework, giving children instructions each week, and telling parents about arrangements and expectations at the start of each term. 

All year groups get their homework on a Friday. 

Key Stage 1 children (Reception and Years 1 and 2) should hand in their finished homework by the following Thursday. 

Key Stage 2 children (Years 3–6) should hand theirs in by Wednesday, to give teachers time to check and mark their work. 

For written work, homework books go into the class homework tray. 

The list below is a general guide to how much homework to expect. 

**Reception**
Half an hour a week (reading, creative activities to support learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum)

**Years 1 and 2**
1 hour a week (reading, spellings, other literacy and number work)

**Years 3 and 4**
1.5 hours a week (literacy and numeracy as for Years 1 and 2, with occasional assignments in other subjects)

**Years 5 and 6**
Up to 30 minutes a day (regular weekly schedule, with continued emphasis on literacy and numeracy but also ranging widely over other
subjects)

In addition, children may get small pieces of work to do with clubs and other activities (e.g. French club homework, learning a part for the school play, etc.)

You can find resources to help you help children with reading, writing and maths on the school website. The school also organises workshops and presentations for parents over the course of the year.

>Darlinghurst School Parent Questionnaire Results 2016 (225 people replied).

>I am happy with the amount and type of work my child is expected to do at home 
>% strongly agreed
>% agreed 
>% disagreed
>% strongly disagreed 

Homework will always divide opinion, with some believing there is too much and others too little. Teachers at Darlinghurst believe that education is a joint responsibility between school and parents, and that together we can find the right balance. If you have any concerns, talk to your child’s teacher. 

#Outdoor Learning
Learning outside the classroom means using places other than the classroom for teaching and learning. It is about getting pupils
out and about, providing them with challenging, exciting and different experiences to help them learn.

Reception classes enjoy a timetabled outdoor learning day every week. The outdoor learning team also work with other year groups to
inspire children to work well and achieve their best in a totally different way to the usual classroom learning.

Darlinghurst’s outdoor learning facilities include:

* ‘Hagrid’s Hut’, which has its own fire pit
* An outdoor learning bus 
* Six beach huts with their own beach 
* A big pond 
* A vegetable garden, with chickens
* Lots of green space to explore and let the children’s interests lead their learning.

For outdoor learning children should wear ...

For more information, contact Ms Arnold [msarnold@darlinghurst.co.uk](msarnold@darlinghurst.co.uk) or Miss Hydes [mrshydes@darlinghurst.co.uk]( mrshydes@darlinghurst.co.uk) or come to one of the outdoor learning family days.

#Trips and Outings 
Teachers at Darlinghurst believe that trips outside school are invaluable to children, not only in terms of the educational gains but
also for developing social skills. Given that some children may not have the opportunity to visit places of interest, for a variety
of reasons, the school sees it as a moral obligation to be able to provide these occasions. 

##Where and when
All trips planned for the academic year are shown on the school [Calendar](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/calendar/). It is not always
possible to calculate the cost and provide a firm date, but the teachers are keen to give parents as much notice
as possible. Trips are generally linked to year-group topics or themes. 

Other unscheduled opportunities may arise during the year; for example, author workshops, library visits and theatre trips. These are
in addition to class trips and may only be available to certain classes or year groups.

Teachers are always in need of volunteers to help supervise the trips.

##Help with the cost of trips
It may be possible to get financial help with school trips. If you think you qualify, ask at the School Office for more information
[pupilservices@darlinghurst.co.uk](pupilservices@darlinghurst.co.uk)

#Promoting Positive Behaviour

Teachers at Darlinghurst promoting positive behaviour through the curriculum and learning. They do this by involving children and
making them feel included and valued. They even do it using the design and layout of classrooms, which should encourage children’s
independence and personal initiative, and with displays around the school that develop children’s self-esteem and raise their
aspirations. 

##Classroom code
At the beginning of each school year, teachers and children work out a classroom code and rewards for good behaviour. The main parts
of the code are:

* Respect for myself 
* Respect for others 
* Respect for property

##The Behaviour Pyramid
Teachers and children also talk about the [Behaviour Pyramid]http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/behaviour-policy.pdf, which is a chart that shows how teachers will deal with negative or disruptive behaviour. A copy of the pyramid is displayed in each classroom and around the school.

For more information, see Darlinghurst’s [Promoting Positive Behaviour Policy](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/behaviour-policy.pdf).

##School rewards

Teachers at Darlinghurst believe in using rewards to promote positive behaviour. Rewards include:

* Praise, public and private
* Student of the Week Awards that run in line with the school's core values
* House points for ...
* Golden tickets for ...
* Fast passes for ...
* Positive comments to parents
* Opportunities for greater responsibilities
* Opportunities for children to participate in a chosen activity.

>_A Golden Ticket winner is dearwn each week. Prizes have included ..._

##Darlinghurst’s School Houses

Darlinghurst is divided into four teams or houses, named after Knights of the Round Table: Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan. 

>_The legendary knights who sat at King Arthur’s **Round Table** were known for their bravery and determination, but were also
chivalrous (polite). The knights sat at a round table, rather than a rectangular one, so they could always see and hear one another,
and it meant that they were equal._

The children receive house points to reward positive behaviour, especially when it is above and beyond what teachers’ would normally
expect. This rewards courteous and collaborative behaviour, and encourage children to work well and respect everyone in the
community.

##Bullying
Darlinghurst aims to ensure that children learn in a supportive, caring and safe environment without fear of being bullied. Bullying
is anti-social behaviour and affects everyone; it is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

Bullying is defined as deliberately hurtful behaviour, repeated over a period of time, where it is difficult for those being bullied
to defend themselves. All school staff, including teachers and middays, look out for signs of bullying and will act promptly and firmly to stop it.

The four main types of bullying are: 

* Physical – e.g. hitting, kicking, theft
* Verbal – e.g. name-calling, racist remarks
* Indirect – e.g. spreading rumours, excluding someone from social group
* Cyber-bullying – using electronic devices and digital media – e.g. text message, picture/video clips (via mobile phone cameras),
phone call, social media, instant messaging, emails. 

Staff will take seriously and investigate all reports of bullying. The class teacher will keep a record of all reported incidents in
a in a black box. Teachers will take steps to reassure and keep safe children who have been victims of bullying, and will punish
bullies when appropriate. And they will always keep parents informed.

Teachers and children discuss bullying as part of the personal social and health education curriculum, and also in class tutorial
time, assemblies ad anti-bullying week. 

Parents should also read the school's anti-bullying code and talk about it with their children. Remind them that that they must tell someone if they are ever bullied.  

You can find Darlinghurst’s [Anti-bullying Policy](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/pupil-anti-bullying-policy-2015.pdf) on the school website 

#Pupil Support 

##Additional educational needs
Darlinghurst is a fully inclusive school that strives to ensure that all children achieve their potential personally, socially,
emotionally and academically in all areas of the curriculum, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, social background, religion,
physical ability and educational needs.

Teachers at Darlinghurst recognise that children learn at different rates and that many factors affect achievement, including
ability, emotional state, age and maturity. Teachers believe that many children, at some time in their school career, may have
difficulties that affect their learning, and that these may be long or short term.

##Special educational needs
Children may have a disability or a special educational need (SEN) if they have a learning need that means they need extra help. This
does not include – on it sown – speaking a home language other than English.

Children have a learning need if, for example:
* They have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children of the same age.
* They have a disability that prevents or hinders them from making use of educational facilities of a kind generally provided for
children of the same age in local schools.
* They do significantly less well than expected for their age range.

For more information, see the school's [Special Educational Needs Policy](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/special-educational-needs-sen.pdf) and [SEN Report](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/sen-information-report.pdf)

You can also contact the school Inclusion Leader and Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo) Mrs Grant: [mrsgrant@darlinghurst.co.uk](mrsgrant@darlinghurst.co.uk)

##Young Carers

Young Carers are children under 18 years of age who help to look after a family member who is disabled, physically or mentally ill or
has substance misuse problems. Caring can involve physical or emotional care or taking responsibility for someone’s safety or
wellbeing. The level or responsibility young carers take on is often inappropriate to their age and at a level beyond simply helping
out with jobs at home, which is a normal part of growing up.

>_As part of the Children’s Society and Carers’ Trust **Young Carers in Schools Programme**, in April 2015 Darlinghurst was the first
school locally, and one of the first nationally, to get a Bronze Award, and in September got a Silver Award._

If you think that your child does this, you can speak to the school Inclusion Lead Mrs Grant [mrsgrant@darlinghurst.co.uk]mrsgrant@darlinghurst.co.uk
or the Learning Mentor Mrs Johnson [mrsjohnson@darlinghurst.co.uk](mrsjohnson@darlinghurst.co.uk).

For more information see Darlinghurst’s [Young Carers Policy](http://www.darlinghurst.uk/documents/young-carers-policy.pdf)

#Bilingual Children 

##Raising and educating bilingual children
Being able to speak two languages has numerous educational, social and economic benefits, particularly in an increasingly globalised
world. For many parents of different cultures, it provides their child with a link to their family heritage. 

Figures suggest that around 70% of the world’s population speak two languages fluently, but raising children as bilingual in the UK
is still seen as pretty ‘special’ and rare. Bilingual children in the UK usually have at least one parent who speaks another
language. But being able to speak two languages or more can have significant benefits, opening up a wealth of job opportunities for
your child when they are older. Often it gives them a strong link to another culture, usually one that is tied up in their family
history.

There are two recognised methods of raising bilingual children. One is to speak the minority language at home, and speak the majority
language at school and in the wider community. The other is One Parent One Language (OPOL), where the parents speak the two different
languages to the child from birth. 

For example, a British man has a Russian wife, and has raised his daughters, aged three and seven, to speak both Russian and English.
He only speaks English to his girls, while his wife has always spoken Russian to them. They could understand both English and Russian
before they could talk, and can now speak both languages fluently. 

**Tips for raising bilingual children**

* Use a recognised method (e.g. minority language at home or OPOL) and be consistent. 
* Decide what level of bilingualism you are aiming for. Some parents will be happy with their child just understanding a second
language without speaking it (passive bilingualism) but others will want their child to eventually read, write, listen and speak both
languages. 
* Be patient. There will be times when children do not understand one language, or hear one and reply in the other – just keep
persevering. 
* Keep speaking your native or the minority language with the children, and mix this non-English language into daily activities. 
* Provide creative and exciting opportunities to expand children’s vocabulary and cultural knowledge in and outside the home. 
* Create a support network with family members and friends in the community, including online social sites. Meet other parents, school educators, children who speak the second language, or a friendly librarian who can get you interesting books in your native
language.
